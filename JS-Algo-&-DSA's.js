/* Big-O Notation: The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation
Big-O notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms
it has two important characteristics
    ** It is expressed in terms of the input
    ** It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details    

Time complexity: 

Example: 
summation(4) = 10
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

Count the number of times
a statement executes based
on the input size

        sum += i;
